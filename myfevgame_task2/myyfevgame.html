    <p class="custom-text">PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a multiplayer online battle royale game in which players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and other supplies. As the match progresses, the playable area on the island shrinks, forcing players to fight each other until only one player or team is left standing. PUBG was released in 2017 and is available on multiple platforms, including PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and mobile devices. Players can choose to play in solo, duo, or squad mode, and can also participate in ranked and unranked matches. The game features a variety of weapons, attachments, and vehicles, as well as different playstyles and tactics that players can use to emerge victorious.</p>
